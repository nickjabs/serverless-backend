The project involves creating AWS Lambda functions to interact with a DynamoDB table. One Lambda function handles GET requests, retrieving data from the table, while another handles POST requests, allowing the addition of new data to the table. These functions can be deployed and exposed through API Gateway to provide a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of books in a DynamoDB database.
